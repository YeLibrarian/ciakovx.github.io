# Course Information
**Title:** Working with Scholarly Literature in R: Pulling, Wrangling, Cleaning, and Analyzing Structured Bibliographic Metadata

**Instructor:**

# Description: 
Developers have created a number of packages for accessing the scholarly literature in R over the last several years, among them rcrossref, rorcid, and roadoi. These packages make use of the APIs in their systems to allow users to execute specific queries and pull the structured data into R, where it can be reshaped, merged with other data, and analyzed. This session will be based on the workshop I provided at last year's FSCI, available at https://ciakovx.github.io/fsci_syllabus.html. The course will assume no experience with R; however, a thorough explanation of the R programming language will not be provided. 
Students will create a free account with Microsoft Azure Notebooks at https://notebooks.azure.com/, which will provide an environment in which we can run R scripts written in Jupyter Notebooks without having to download R and R studio. Students will then download an IPNYB (Jupyter Notebooks) file containing the scripts for the workshop, and will open that notebook in Azure. The file will include executable code alongside descriptions of what the code is doing. Students can therefore run code that has already been written, but will also write and execute their own R scripts within the Azure environment.
We will begin with a general orientation of the Jupyter Notebooks environment. We will then discuss R and provide a basic overview of how it works. This introduction will include reading data into R, installing packages, and some functions for cleaning and restructuring data. We will also discuss Crossref, ORCID, and Unpaywall, and the packages developed by the rOpenSci organization to access the API services of these organizations. 
We will then walk through the tasks outlined at https://ciakovx.github.io/rorcid.html and https://ciakovx.github.io/rcrossref.html. All course content will be delivered synchronously, with exercises built into the Jupyter Notebooks.
rorcid interfaces with the ORCID API, allowing users to pull publication data based on a specific ORCID iD, or to input names and other identifying information to find a specific individualâ€™s identifier. 
rcrossref interfaces with the CrossRef API, allowing users to pull article metadata based on ISSN, filter queries by publication date and license information, running queries by title and author, getting funder data, getting citation counts, and exporting to BibTeX, RIS, and CSV. This can be immensely powerful for collecting citation data, conducting literature reviews, creating bibliographies, and more.
roadoi interfaces with Unpaywall, allowing users to input a set of DOIs and return publication information along with potential locations of open access versions.
As we work through the tutorials, Students will continue to learn R functions for working with data, including dplyr, purrr, and tidyr. 
By the conclusion of the session, students will be able to work with and analyze data in R. On a deeper level, they will have more powerful tools for gathering subsets of the scholarly literature in clean and structured formats based on specific parameters. Because they will be walking away with executable scripts, they will be able to modify those and collect data based on parameters they are interested in. 
Level: All levels
Intended audience: This course is intended for scholarly communications librarians, repository managers, research funders, publishers, bibliometricians, and managers of Research Information Management Systems (RIMS).

# Requirements: 
Students will need a computer with internet access and a free Microsoft Azure Notebooks account. It will not be necessary to download R or R Studio.

# Course Learning Objectives
A participant in this course will, at the end of the course, be able to:
- Use R to complete a range of data tasks, including understanding R syntax and data types, installing and loading packages, reading data from files and APIs, and executing functions for tidying and  analyzing data.
- Use the rorcid package in R to extract data from ORCID profiles, including authenticating with the ORCID API, finding ORCID iDs by name/affiliation, getting author biographical information, and getting works associated with individuals.
- Use the rcrossref and roadoi packages in R to extract data from the Crossref and Unpaywall database, including authenticating with the Crossref API, forming queries, getting publication information, getting data on articles, converting articles to BibTeX/RIS, getting citation data, and checking for open access versions.

# Course Topics
This course will cover these  topics:
Introduction to R and RStudio
Introduction to rorcid
Introduction to rcrossref and roadoi

# Other Resources
If students have time, it is recommended to install and work through the swirl package in R at https://swirlstats.com/students.html. This will give them a good introduction to R and RStudio.
