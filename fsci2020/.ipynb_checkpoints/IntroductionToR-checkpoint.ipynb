    "\n",
    "The guide was originally created by Clarke Iakovakis in 2018 for an [ALCTS webinar](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.8029301), and updated in 2019 for a course at the Texas Conference on Digital Libraries, then again at the 2019 FSCI, and finally for the 2020 FSCI. I am the Scholarly Services Librarian at the Oklahoma State University Library. I began using R in 2013 out of curiosity. The only background in computer programming I had at the time was a class in high school on Visual Basic, and a sparse knowledge of XML, HTML and CSS picked up in library school. My bachelor's degree is in history, and I am currently finishing my master's in the same discipline. My level of data literacy was relatively low as well--for instance, I did not really know what CSV files were or how to work with them. In other words, my background is in the humanities--not math, not science, not statistics, not computer science, not computer programming. **You do not have to be a statistician or programmer to learn and use R!**\n",
    "\n",
    "I first enrolled in an R course created by Lynda.com, which provided an excellent basic foundation. I then completed several [R courses in Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/courses?languages=en&query=r), and read a couple of books on R (see the R Resources at the end of this document). I began forcing myself to solve my data problems in R rather than going back to the spreadsheet software I was more comfortable and familiar with. I felt considerable satisfaction after creating solutions to complex problems in R, and I began gaining critical insights into my data that simply were not possible using other platforms. This was enough to offset the frustration and anxiety of using a new tool. It has become a critical part of my work as a librarian, and a week rarely passes without my using it in some way.\n",

    "## What is R?\n",
    "\n",
    "R is more of a programming language than a statistics program. It was started by Robert Gentleman and Ross Ihaka from the University of Auckland in 1995. They described it as \"a language for data analysis and graphics.\"[^1] You can use R to create, import, and scrape data from the web; clean and reshape it; visualize it; run statistical analysis and modeling operations on it; text and data mine it; and much more.\n",
    "\n",
    "[^1]: Ross Ihaka & Robert Gentleman, \"R: A Language for Data Analysis and Graphics,\" *Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics* 5, no. 3 (1996): 299-314. <https://www.jstor.org/stable/1390807>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages of R\n",
    "\n",
    "R has a large user base in a variety of fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Multiple academic disciplines: Statistics, Education, Genomics, Earth Sciences, Finance, Linguistics, Literature\n",
    "* Data science\n",
    "* Tech industry: Microsoft, Google, Facebook\n",
    "* [Major companies](http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2012/06/applications-of-r-in-government.html): American Express, Ford, Uber\n",
    "* Journalism: The New York Times, The Guardian\n",
    "* [Government](http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2012/06/applications-of-r-in-government.html): National Weather Service, Federal Drug Administration\n",
    "\n",
    "The user community is large, diverse, and active. Many times I will Google my questions or look them up in [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), and copy/paste code directly into my script. the R community is open and supportive, which helps immensely in solving problems with your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "R is also free and open source, distributed under the terms of the [GNU General Public License.](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html). This means it is free to download and use the software for any purpose, modify it, and share it. As a result, R users have created thousands of packages and software to enhance user experience and functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Drawbacks of R\n",
    "\n",
    "As described in [this video by R expert Roger Peng](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STihTnVSZnI), the objects you manipulate in R are stored in the physical memory of the computer. One drawback to this is, if you are working with really **big** data, it can bog down your computer. Moreover, if the objects you are working with are bigger than the memory of the computer, you can't load it into memory or use. In other words, R is not necessarily the best platform for working with big data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another potential drawback to R for some people is that you write commands by hand, character-by-character. You have a console window with a blinking cursor, and you type in a command according to the R syntax in order to make it do something. This can be intimidating for people who are used to Graphical User Interface (GUI) software such as Excel, where you use the mouse to point and click, and never or seldom have to type anything into the interface in order to get it to do something. Roger Peng has [another video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXrHkIz-krE&list=PLjTlxb-wKvXNSDfcKPFH2gzHGyjpeCZmJ) explaining this in more detail. While this can be seen as a drawback, it actually becomes a great advantage once you learn the R language, as you are not bound by the options presented to you in a GUI, but can craft flexible and creative commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Downloading R\n",
    "\n",
    "Go to <https://www.r-project.org/>. Click on CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network) under Download, and scroll down to your country. Select the download link corresponding to the city that is geographically closest to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Wrangling\n",
    "\n",
    "By expanding the tools you use to manipulate data, you also open new possibilities for data interpretation, analysis, visualization, and, crucially, communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the model of data analysis presented in Hadley Wickam's book [Data Wrangling with R](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/explore-intro.html) (licensed under CC BY-NC-ND), data wrangling is the getting, cleaning, and transforming phase, which feeds into the visualization and modeling phases, to be followed by the communicating phase."

    "\n",
    "It will require some investment of time to learn R syntax, functions, error messages, idiosyncrasies, and limitations. However, it is incredibly powerful and can be a more efficient way to wrangle and clean data than traditional spreadsheet software. You therefore must weigh that investment of time against the expected advantages of adopting R. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you working with data is an integral part of your job, and you consistently run up against the limitations of spreadsheet software, then the investment may be worthwhile. As you are learning and integrating R into your workflow, you will likely spend significantly more time solving data problems than going back to your laborious and inconvenient, but tried-and-true methods. As explained by Hall & Khan,\n",
    "\n",
    "> adoption [of new technology] is  usually  an  absorbing  state,  in  the  sense  that  we  rarely  observe  a  new  technology being abandoned in favor of an old one. This is because the decision to adopt faces a large benefit minus cost hurdle; once this hurdle is passed, the costs are sunk and the decision to abandon requires giving up the benefit without regaining the cost.[^3] \n",
    "\n",
    "It is my contention that for those of us who regularly work with data, the benefits of using R are so clear, there will likely be a crossover point. This is particularly true if you work at a smaller library and do not currently have a collection analysis tool."

We now have access to the tools and storage to manipulate these data streams to learn more about our communities, collections, and services.

See [this page from RStudio](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/201057987-Quick-list-of-useful-R-packages) for a good list of useful R packages. In addition to CRAN, R users can make their code and packages available from [GitHub](https://github.com/trending/r). Finally, some communities host their own collections of R packages, such as [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/) for computational biology and bioinformatics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Installing CRAN packages can be done from the RStudio console. Click the Packages tab in the Navigation Pane, then click Install and search for the package you're looking for. You can also use the `install.packages()` function directly in the console. Run `help(install.packages)` to learn more about how to do it this way."
