On the other hand, `works()` returns a nice, neat data frame that can be easily exported to a CSV. \n",

Thanks to both ORCID and Scott Chamberlain for their contributions to the community. Again, read Paul Oldham's excellent post at https://www.pauloldham.net/introduction-to-orcid-with-rorcid/ for more you can do. I hope this walkthrough  helps.
