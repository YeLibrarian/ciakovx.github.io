I am currently the Scholarly Services Librarian at Oklahoma State University. I graduated from the School of Information at the University of Texas in 2011 with an MS in Information Studies, and from Texas State University in 2006 with a BA in History. I previously worked at the University of Houston-Clear Lake and the University of Texas at Arlington.
